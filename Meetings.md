## Objectives
 Learning Programming
Transferable Skills
Till July 2021 

## Questions we have 
Which framework to use?
What costs is there to publish?
How to work together (codebase)
Timeframe for the entire project?
How many hours to commit per week?
Stinky fish: What are worries, anxieties about working together?


## Questions we have for mentor
Mentor What do you want to talk about? *

Which elements and platforms are necessary for building a mobile app for iOS and Android?
And which ones do you recommend given our level of experience?
In order to get a good app and also transferable skills of programming what do you recommend, react or flutter?
Visual studio, react native, xcode, github, etc
What is the full ecosystem of resources needed and a typical start to finish timeline/task list?
What are good learning resources for first time app developers?
What order? How to work? 
One App at a time
Which Platform?

Notes

Code academy
Do Javascript and then React Native (do courses by next week)
Also do a Github course
Set up a repository

Github Rafa - rg0wv0
Sbxcode on Github

Github Trello board

Notes

Which framework fits your way of thinking?
Python for data science
Separate platforms have separate languages (iOS, web, Android)
Deploying cross-platform - write it once and it is then compiled
The cross-platform framework is made for humans
Flutter and React Native (React Native is what Mentor uses)
React - javascript
Flutter - dart - not transferable to web design
React - bring your own logic
Angular has opinions and flows of information
React a bigger learning curve

https://expo.io/  framework
Wrapper around react native - removes annoying bits
Work android, ios, web

First app will be awful haha

Certain ways to manage your data

Sketch from Mentor about final product
Pick the parts

2-3 components based on how you pick them
.1. Writing code experience
Sublime text (visual studio also option)
Plugins important
Development flow preferences 

.2. Dev ops
How is your infrastructure set up
How you manage your code
Learn GIT
Github, gitlab (mentor prefers github)
Save game system
Branching, merging, ect (advanced)
Commit a change and push a change

.3. Managing the infrastructure
Need a server? A database?
Two code bases - one for phone - one for virtual machine (for database etc)

Continuous integration system (CI) - Github actions or Travis
System that listens to changes and then deploys it


Github is triggered and spits up a virtual browser and does tests
If tests succeed, it will deploy it to host and database (firebase)

Services and frameworks
Firebase
Backend as a service
Most apps are not unique
Store data, processing, same processes
Copy and paste from their library
Limited to their assumptions
Free tier

Expo (react project)
React course - code academy - https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-101 
React does visual markup in jsx - html with extra logic
React native complicates (html has semantic elements) and react native has different words
Systems are different
Redux - manage data for front end applications

Learning - If I was to teach myself react all over again
Don’t think of an app that you want to build
Think of the simplest app
Fill in numbers and calculate returns

Publishing the app
Write the source code
Files
You run a build command
Expo build
It produces 1 file
Android - apk file
Ios - ipa file
Program execute
Enter into the developer console
Apple $100
Google $50
That’s the verification needed
Very visual
Screenshots of virtual devices - dimensions
Useless and ugly apps may not be accepted by apple
They don’t kick you off
Muting, reporting, blocking systems

Testing
Testflight
Expo - you can see your app previewed
Expo app opens your app
Google beta test

App can be free or paid

Skills and learning
Code academy and react
Other learning resources
Disconnect between practical and theoretical
Courses are more theoretical
Create react app (resource) - https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app or expo
Expo documentation
Youtube has good videos

An app can be built in 24h

Model-view-controller on Youtube (way to think)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller 

Rafa’s app
Let go of the concept of database
Self contained database
Text file filled with sentences
Start with just one language
1 of 3 sentences will show up
Then go up

Work on 2 platforms?
We will write code once for both platforms
Preview windows for many devices
You build your app on your own
Working together is a skill for coding

Yatan’s app
Same application than Rafa
Yatan will add a timer
Button will count down and will show a sentence
Expand for user to use their timer
Integration will come later
Links the integration

One text file
Then expand into user inputting their own sentences

Sketching for apps
Visual parts, mock ups
Platform called Figma
Designer can design - then switches to code for programmer





## Next steps

Git part - github
React native (code academy)
Sublime text
Expo

Common repository
Yatan will send the setup - more ruby focused




## December 30th, 2020

Rafa:
Best resource I found regarding deploying an app to the Apple App Store
https://readybytes.in/blog/how-to-deploy-a-react-native-ios-app-on-the-app-store
Still have more questions, but I think it is necessary to go through the process in order to better understand what the specific questions are.

Rafa:
Questions for Mentor








## December 24th, 2020
Tech Specifications
Cross Platform: App Store & Play Store

Framework:
React Native (created by FB)
Flutter 



## Step-by-step (To-Dos)
Map out step-by-step process for getting an app to the app stores
Yatan - Android
Rafa - iOS

Yatan - organize conversation with Mentor about app creating/publishing process
Create a set of questions
First week of January - Meeting with Mentor

How to work together?
Start weekly - then bi-weekly
Python and JavaScript - possibly useful languages



## App Specifications
### Rafa: Random Act of Kindness
How can we prompt people to make their life more interesting (like wow moments in movies)
Prompts of Kindness or Interesting Actions
Timeframe 
Database of Actions
Actions that are not difficult but very meaningful


### Yatan: Deep work companion app 
Deep work
Antidote to social media and recommendation engines / calls to your attention
Timer - pre-select timeframes for you to work and best environment to work (music, etc)
What do you want to do with your breaks?
Ex. 4 times for 25 min (work) - Breaks will be? (instagram, music, etc)
Pomodoro method
Progress report - history
Meet again next week - 30 december - 9am Brazil / 1pm CET

https://nevercode.io/blog/flutter-vs-react-native-a-developers-perspective/ 
https://www.thedroidsonroids.com/blog/flutter-vs-react-native-what-to-choose-in-2020 

React Native
Based on JS
Older, bigger community

Flutter
Based on Dart 
Newer, supported by Google so likely to overtake React

App Stores
Steps to Get an App on to the Play Store
Sources:

https://medium.com/@the_manifest/how-to-publish-an-app-on-google-play-a-step-by-step-guide-80f9f533e370 

Step 1: Google Play Developer Console one time $25 fee 
Step 2: Plan to Sell? Link Your Merchant Account (also in app purchases)
Step 3: Create an App on Play Console (with language of choice)
Step 4: Prepare Store Listing (Description, Screenshots etc, can be done later)
Step 5: Upload APK file to App Release
Step 6: Provide an Appropriate Content Rating
Step 7: Set Up Pricing & Distribution (free or paid) 
Step 8: Rollout Release to Publish Your App
Maintain and Market App :)

Need to be in a supported country (Germany and Brazil supported)
Google only allows apps of 50MB or less to be published as a single APK file. 
When set to free, you cannot change price back


Non Play :=)

Apple charges $99 per year. 
Microsoft charges between $12 and $99 per year, depending on the account type.
